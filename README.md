# LOGIEXPRESS
The application is intended to provide an interprovincial logistics service taking advantage of the ‘downtime’ faced by carriers independent. In other words, the ultimate goal of our platform is to allow truckers manage, efficiently, simply and centrally, both their time like empty space in their trucks. It will also allow the user to quote and the ability to track your cargo live. Payments will be accepted through the application and once the trips are completed, both parties will be able to rank and / or leave comments about the service provided.
